== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need a UPS Account to use this plugin..? =
Yes. WooCommerce UPS shipping requires a UPS Account and the Account Details(UPS User ID, UPS Password, UPS Access Key, UPS Account Number) to get the shipping rates based on the services that are enabled for that account. Also, the plugin is capable of getting the negotiated rates based on the UPS Account Details.
= Will this plugin work for my country and currency..? =
WooCommerce UPS Shipping plugin works for all the countries and their currencies which are supported by UPS. In order to check which countries are supported by UPS, kindly refer the [UPS WooCommerce](https://wwwapps.ups.com/ctc/request?loc=en_US) Price Calculator. You can also use Aelia currency switcher plugin or the WooCommerce Currency switcher plugin to work with this plugin.
= Which UPS Shipping services are supported by this plugin..? =
WooCommerce UPS plugin supports all the UPS domestic and international shipping services except UPS Freight. To use UPS Freight services, you need to purchase the Premium Version. You can select your preferred shipping service in the Services section in the plugin settings. However, the shipping rates for a particular service depends on whether the service is available for the destination address.
= Currently I have not measured or weighed my products. Can I still get rates? =
It is mandatory to put in product weight and dimensions while fetching the rates. =
= My rates are coming as multiples of the item quantity. If I keep 2 items in cart, then the rate is getting doubled? Why is that happening?
The basic version is meant for small shop-owners who have 1 or 2 products in their inventory. Hence packing happens individually. In the premium plugin, there are additional packing methodologies like box packing, weight based packing using which you can get the rates for multiple items without any problems.
= Will your UPS & USPS plugins work smoothly together to have both shipping options available for customer to choose from? =
Yes. You are absolutely right. Both will work mutually exclusive and customer will be presented with both shipping options to choose from. Hope it clarifies.
= Why am I getting such high shipping rates after adding more products to the cart..? =
The plugin supports Individual Packaging for products. In other words, the plugin takes each product as a separate package and calculates the shipping cost per package. This way, if there are two products in the cart, the shipping rates will be double. And so on.
The Premium Version of the plugin supports other packing methods such as Box Packing with Custom Weight & Dimensions and Weight based Packing.
= I am not getting the rates from the plugin = 
No worries. Just go to plugin settings page, enable the debug option. Once the debug is enabled, go to cart and place an order. In the cart page, you will see the request and response information. Copy them and send it to our support so that we can help you.
= What are Fallback Rates..? =
Incase the WooCommerce UPS rates are not returned from the API, you can enable fallback rates and provide a value which will be displayed on the cart page instead of the real-time rates.
= Can I use this plugin only for Print label and charge the customers a flat rate I set? =
No. The basic version is meant for fetching real time rates. You can use our premium plugin for Print label and charge your own rate for shipping.
= I am not able to tracking my shipments using the plugin? =
Using the basic plugin, it is not possible to track your shipments. The basic plugin is used for fetching rates from the UPS API. Tracking and label generation are available in the our premium plugin.
